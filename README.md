*Plant Disease Detection Android App* 🌱📱

*Overview*
This Android application leverages machine learning and computer vision to detect plant diseases in real time. It integrates a TensorFlow Lite model to classify 38 different plant diseases using a custom-trained CNN model on a dataset of 59,305 images.

*Key Features*

✅ Real-Time Disease Detection – Capture or upload images to instantly identify plant diseases.

✅ Machine Learning Integration – Uses TensorFlow Lite and models like ResNet50, InceptionV3, and custom CNN for high accuracy.

✅ Cloud-Powered Backend – Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Firebase for authentication, storage, and real-time predictions.

✅ Optimized for Mobile – Achieves 90%+ validation accuracy with InceptionV3, ensuring fast and efficient performance.

*Tech Stack*

🔹 Frontend: Java, Kotlin, Android Studio

🔹 Machine Learning: TensorFlow Lite, Scikit-learn

🔹 Backend: Firebase, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

*How It Works*

1️⃣ User uploads a plant image (or captures one using the camera).

2️⃣ Image is processed using the TensorFlow Lite model.

3️⃣ The app predicts the disease and displays the result.

4️⃣ Recommendation system provides basic guidance based on the detected disease!
